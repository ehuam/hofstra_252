# Closure in Perl, simple example: a toggle between 1 and 0
sub maketoggle
{
    my $x = 1; # initially sets toggle value to 1
    sub { $x= 1-$x; $x } # switches x between 1 and 0
} # maketoggle  (returns the inner sub as a closure)
my $tg1 = maketoggle(0);
my $tg2 = maketoggle(0);
print $tg1->(2), "\n";   # 0
print $tg1->(2), "\n";   # 1
print $tg1->(2), "\n";   # 0
print $tg1->(2), "\n";   # 1
print $tg2->(2), "\n";   # 0  this shows that state info is maintained.


#### Extending closures to full objects.
# Bank accounts in perl (corresponds to scheme program in handout).
# there's another way of doing oop in perl - involving packages and 
# something called "bless".  I'm not using that - I'm using perl's 
# more fundamental capabilities to build oop from scratch, like in scheme

sub newaccount
{
   my $balance = $_[0];

   my $inquiry = sub { $balance };
   my $deposit = sub { $balance = $balance + $_[0]; };

   my $chargefee = sub { $balance -= 3; }; # "private" method
   my $withdraw = sub 
		  { $balance = $balance - $_[0]; &$chargefee(); };
  
   # return interface function:
   sub
   {
     my $method = $_[0]; # requested method
     if ($method eq withdraw) { return $withdraw; }
     if ($method eq deposit)  { return $deposit; }
     if ($method eq inquiry)  { return &$inquiry(); }
       else { die "error"; }
